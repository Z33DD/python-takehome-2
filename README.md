# Ethyca Code Test -- Open Source Engineer (Python)

## User Story
As a keen noughts and crosses (/tic-tac-toe) player (and aspiring champion), I need a web service that allows me to play against a computer via a REST API. The API must allow me to create a new game, make the next move in a game, and list all games previously played.

### Noughts and Crosses (Tic-tac-toe)
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English) is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. ~It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.~

An example game series can be represented as:
```
# A blank board
[
    [".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", "."],
]

# First move
[
    [".", ".", "."],
    [".", "X", "."],
    [".", ".", "."],
]

# Second move
[
    [".", ".", "."],
    [".", "X", "."],
    [".", ".", "O"],
]

# Third move
[
    [".", ".", "X"],
    [".", "X", "."],
    ["O", ".", "O"],
]

...and so forth
```

## Your Task
Use Python (any flavour) to develop a REST API that:
- Allows me to create a new game of Noughts and Crosses, and returns the game ID.
- Allows me to make the next move by specifying the co-ordinates I wish to move on. e.g. `{"x": 1, "y": 1}` would denote a move to the middle square by the requesting player, and returns the new state of the board _after_ the computer has made its move in turn. __Note: There is no need to create an AI opponent, random moves are fine__
- Allows me to view all moves in a game, chronologically ordered.
- Allows me to view all games I have played, chronologically ordered.
- Surprise us! Use your inherent style and panache to sprinkle that extra bit of gee-whizz atop your solution.


## Notes
- Please work independently without code review by others.
- It's our intention that you spend between 3 and 4 hours on this task.
- This challenge is deliberately vague on detail to give candidates the opportunity for a wide range of solutions. That being said, feel free to reach out and ask questions as needed.
- There is no 100% correct solution, be creative! We are just as interested in your approach to problem solving as we are in your actual solution.
- Code style, comments, and general code hygiene matter despite this being a test!


## Delivery
- Once completed, please create a README file describing:
  - How to run your project (or where it is hosted),
  - How much time you spent building the project,
  - Any assumptions you made,
  - Any trade-offs you made,
  - Any special/unique features you added,
  - Anything else you want us to know about,
  - Any feedback you have on this technical challenge -- we care deeply about our hiring process here at Ethyca, and about the engineers who go through it (that's you!) -- we wholeheartedly promise any feedback will be met with a warm thank you!
- The assignment can be published and shared with us via any code sharing platform such as Github, Gitlab, or sent as a .zip file to the Ethyca employee who sent you this task.
